####updated 7/23/2014 with additional questions at the beginning with letters instead of numbers to preserve question numbering. The lettered questions are easier and should be done first.###

#a) Display everything for all states

#b) Display the section and description for each section of the VRA

#c) Select the name and region of each state with a population of over 1,000,000

#d) What is total population of the US? (hint: add the populations of all the states)

#e) What possible regions can a state be in?

#f) What is the total population of the southern region?

#g) What is the average state population from each region?

#h) How many cities have a population of more than 500,000?



#These questions are harder and many will require joining multiple tables

#1 Which state has the largest percent of hispanic-identified individuals?

#2 Which state has the largest number of hispanic-identified individuals?

#3 Find the population density (#people/land area) of each city

#4 what is the total land area taken up by cities with a population of more than 1million?

#5 Find the region of every city

#6 how many of the top 50 cities are in each region?

#7 which states have more than 2 cities in the top 50?

#8 list all of the states where section 5 applies

#9 find all of the cities where no parts of the VRA apply

#10 what is the average percent of the population of each race in states where each section of the VRA applies (also include the average for states where no section applies)
#note that in general I think averaging percents is a bad idea, but this is an exercise
#and percents is what wikipedia provided.
